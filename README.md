This deep dive describes how to manually mount various types of file systems on Linux, including filesystems on remote servers, and both local and remote file systems that are configured in `/etc/fstab`. I wrote this piece since I was trying to figure out how to (locally) mount both local filesystems and the remote filesystem that hosts my website, [joshgoldstein.org](https://www.joshgoldstein.org). Without further ado, please enjoy my guide to [mounting filesystems](manually_mount_a_filesystem.md).
