This deep dive describes how to manually mount various types of file systems on Linux, including filesystems on remote servers, and both local and remote file systems that are configured in `/etc/fstab`. I wrote this piece since I was trying to figure out how to mount my local filesystems and the remote filesystem that hosts my website, [joshgoldstein.org](https://www.joshgoldstein.org).

> **NOTE:** The links in this tutorial usually do **not** work on GitHub because I maintain the source material in a local repo that is optimized for [Obsidian](obsidian.md), which uses a different syntax for linking. Additionally, my source repo references another document I authored that is about automounting filesystems. That document is not included in this public repo, however, so the link to that document is not operational, either.

Without further ado, please enjoy my guide to [mounting filesystems](manually_mount_a_filesystem.md).
